<p>Sorry, but the page you’re looking for doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for something in particular you might find it either on the <a href="/">home page</a> or the <a href="">blog</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re exceedingly annoyed that you’ve not only waited for a page that doesn’t exist but that you’ve also read all this without learning the secret to a happy life, you can <a href="">send me a strongly-worded email</a> if you like.</p>
